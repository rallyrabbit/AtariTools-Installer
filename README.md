## Purpose
This is the NSIS for all of the Atari Tools that I use for windows.  This includes an installer (only x86, none of the x64 versions of Stella), uninstaller, lists the whole thing in Add/Remove programs, and adds the tools to the path.

My Goal is to keep a pulse on the Atari Tool Releases for the few active projects and update the installer as new items come out.  Some of the tools included have varying licenses and are no longer maintained.
